# Knight-vs-Dragon-v2
I remade my classic 10th grade project in the 11th grade.

This time I focused on making the interface cleaner. I used a lot of screen clears to keep things clean, 16 year old me loved those.
The game is much more complex, where the Dragon is able to do more, and there's more consequnces for player actions.

There's even a pvp multiplayer mode that fully works! One player plays as the Knight, while the other the Dragon. The Dragon has a full moveset, and is honestly impressive I thought of all this when I was 16. Good job past me!

Maybe I should do a modern day remake of this.
